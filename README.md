# FastImageEditor

Basically a light-weight Image Processor App... for ~~Windows Forms~~ (the goal is to not be tied to a particular framework)

Written in C# and linked against custom-tuned C++ libraries.

Features:

- Multicore aware, tries to split workloads where possible.
- maximize the potential of your desktop x86/x86-64 Intel or Amd CPU by using SIMD data paralellism. 
- simple design allows user to access complex things
